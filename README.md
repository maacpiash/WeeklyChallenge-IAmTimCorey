I have been working with C# language, in general, for about 3 years. That's probably not a lot of time to call myself experienced in a programming language. While I'm always trying to learn more and more of this beautiful language, I realize that just reading through docs.microsoft.com isn't enough â€” I need to get my hands dirty, on a regular basis.

Recently (mid July 2019) I found out [IAmTimCorey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ptWR16ITQyYOglXyQmpzw)'s [Weekly Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLWMQd6PeGY1VcJGocm1wwtFCZUrh2sc9) playlist while browsing through YouTube. At first the problems seemed a bit too easy for me, but I realized that trying to solve these problems could give me an opportunity not only to practice C# on a regular basis but also to try out the latest features of C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0.

I will try to solve all the problems in the playlist and push all my solutions to this repository, in separate directories with `csproj` file, source files and a `README.md` file. I intend to solve problems on a regular basis.

Feel free to open an issue or a PR if you have something to say!
